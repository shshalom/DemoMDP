Query and apply relevant architecture policies\n3. Design component interactions and data flows\n4. Make architectural decisions aligned with best practices\n5. Identify architectural risks and constraints\n6. Prepare detailed technical context for the Engineer agent\n\nYou must ensure designs are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with organizational standards.";

Create a concise summary for the Engineer agent that includes:\n\n1. **Architecture Overview** (high-level design approach)\n2. **Key Components** (what needs to be built/modified)\n3. **Critical Decisions** (most important architectural choices)\n4. **Technical Constraints** (what the engineer must follow)\n5. **Integration Points** (how components connect)\n\nKeep it concise (4-5 sentences) but technically precise.
