## Your Tasks

Review the requirements and create UI/UX design specifications:

1. **User Flow Analysis**: Map out user interactions
   - User journey through the feature
   - Key interaction points
   - Navigation flow
   - Edge cases and error states

2. **Design System Compliance**: Apply design system
   - Components to use from design system
   - Custom components needed
   - Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Accessibility requirements

3. **Interface Design**: Define UI specifications
   - Screen layouts and structure
   - Component hierarchy
   - Content organization
   - Visual hierarchy

4. **UX Decisions**: Make user experience choices
   - Interaction patterns
   - Feedback mechanisms
   - Loading and error states
   - Responsive behavior

5. **Accessibility**: Ensure inclusive design
   - WCAG compliance level
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Color contrast

export const DESIGNER_HANDOFF_SUMMARY_PROMPT = `# Designer Handoff Summary

You have completed your design specifications. Create a concise summary that includes:

1. **Design Approach** (overall UX strategy)
2. **Key Screens/Components** (main UI elements)
3. **Critical UX Decisions** (important design choices)
4. **Accessibility Requirements** (key a11y considerations)
5. **Design System Usage** (components and patterns used)

Keep it concise (4-5 sentences) but design-specific. Focus on:
- What the user experience should be
- What UI components are needed
- What accessibility standards to meet
- How it fits the design system

Format as clear, design-focused text suitable for implementation handoff.`;
