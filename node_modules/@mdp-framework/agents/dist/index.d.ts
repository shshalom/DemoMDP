/**
 * PHASE 1 DELIVERABLES (Weeks 1-3): ✅ COMPLETE
 *
 * ✅ Agent base class with execute/handoff methods
 * ✅ AgentWorkflow orchestrator (SequentialAgentWorkflow)
 * ✅ Blackboard shared state implementation
 * ✅ Handoff protocol (prepare → receive)
 *
 * PHASE 2 DELIVERABLES (Weeks 4-5): ✅ COMPLETE
 *
 * ✅ PM Agent (product requirements and scope analysis)
 * ✅ Architect Agent (architecture design and decisions)
 * ✅ Engineer Agent (implementation planning and task breakdown)
 * ✅ Designer Agent (UI/UX design and accessibility)
 * ✅ Prompt templates for all agents
 * ✅ JSON decision schemas for structured output
 * ✅ Unit tests for all reference agents
 * ✅ Golden test for full PM → Architect → Engineer workflow
 *
 * PHASE 3 (Future): TODO
 * - Integration with Stream 3 (MCP Server) for policy queries
 * - Additional agent types (QA, DevOps, Security, etc.)
 * - Advanced orchestration patterns (parallel execution, conditional flows)
 */

/**
 * CONTRACT COMPLIANCE:
 *
 * All FROZEN interfaces from STREAM-5-MULTI-AGENT.md are implemented:
